## 0.1.0 (11/01/2026)

- Added `iOS` support. This is a total mess :( I’m definitely doing something wrong on `iOS` and will come back to it later before merging it into `master`, but at least it’s working :). The `iOS` `nitrogen` generated code is available in this [repo](https://github.com/henriquecicero/react-native-exploring-nitro-modules);
- Added new benchmarks from my `iOS` device.

# Roadmap

- [x] Update `react-native` and other core dependencies.
- [x] Add `iOS` support for `Nitro` and `Turbo` Modules. :(
- [ ] **I’ll try to keep my side of the street clean on `iOS`. I promise. It's really hard to get it right, but I'm trying my best** :)
- [ ] Add `Rust` support using `UniFFI`. I have a [repo](https://github.com/henriquecicero/react-native-exploring-turbo-modules-rust) to help with that.
- [ ] Add `Expo` Modules support.
